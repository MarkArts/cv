\section{Personal Profile}

I'm a passionate and curious programmer with a broad skill set looking for a position where he can utilize and learn interesting technologies and tools. \\

I started programming for my bachelor and quickly decided to combine my studies with work to learn what it means to work in a professional context. After finishing my studies, I worked as a backender and later DevOps, in which roles I actively engaged with the technologies around me, making sure to pick up tasks outside my skillset to expand my knowledge and experience, for example, picking up FE stories from the backlog. \\

My more recent focus has been on developing my soft skills as a team lead, providing my teammates opportunities to develop their skills, improving our processes by regular reflection, taking charge of our infrastructure efficiency, security, cost, and reliability, and transforming business requirements into actionable stories.

Besides web development and DevOps, I enjoy reading and learning about Artificial Intelligence, security/hacking, game development, mental and physical health, Blockchains, and most subjects regularly discussed on Hacker News. \\

One of my biggest hobbies is music. It's the perfect outlet for my curiosity, creativity, drive to improve, and playfulness. All aspects of music are interesting to me, from songwriting to physically playing instruments to mastering songs and everything in between. Giving me an endless playground for self-improvement and learning.  \\

I'm a fast and enthusiastic learner that is always up for a new challenge.
